## üìä Architecture Overview

### File Structure
```
exec-dashboard/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html                    # Main application file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ default-dashboard-config.json # Default configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                     # Documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE                       # MIT license
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CONTRIBUTING.md              # This file
```

### Code Organization (within index.html)
- **HTML Structure**: Layout and form elements
- **CSS Styles**: All styling in `<style>` section
- **JavaScript Modules**:
  - Global data storage (`expenses`, `initiatives`)
  - Expense management functions
  - Initiative management functions  
  - Chart generation and updates
  - JSON export/import functionality
  - localStorage persistence

### Key Functions to Understand
- `updateChart()`: Regenerates the capital burn and roadmap visualization
- `renderExpenses()` / `renderInitiatives()`: Update the data tables
- `exportToJson()` / `loadDashboardData()`: Handle data persistence
- `autoSave()`: Automatic localStorage backup

## üîß Common Tasks

### Adding a New Expense Field
1. Add the field to the expense object structure
2. Update `renderExpenses()` to display the field
3. Update `updateExpense()` to handle changes
4. Update the JSON export format if needed

### Adding a New Chart Type
1. Study the existing Chart.js configuration
2. Add new dataset to the `datasets` array
3. Update chart options if needed
4. Test with various data scenarios

### Improving Mobile Experience
1. Focus on the CSS media queries
2. Test on actual mobile devices
3. Consider touch interaction improvements
4. Optimize table layouts for small screens
